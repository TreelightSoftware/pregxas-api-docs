# Pregxas API Docs

Pregxas is an open-source community-based prayer management system. There is the main Pregxas application, hosted by Treelight Software, but you are free to take the server and applications (or build your own clients!) and use it to keep track of prayer plans, prayer requests, and more for your group, regardless of faith or background. The application assumes it is the host with smaller communities within the site. If you don't want to host your own server, you may signup for a free or paid hosted version with us!

*What does pregxas mean?*

Pregxas (preh-jas) is a verb from Esperanto which means to pray in the present tense. For example, "mi pregxas" (I pray), "ni pregxas" (we pray).

These are the docs for the server found at [https://github.com/TreelightSoftware/pregxas-api](https://github.com/TreelightSoftware/pregxas-api)

## I'm New, How Can I Help

There are many ways to help, and we are a very open group that has no problem helping along newer contributors, whether new to the industry or just new to Go!

If you don't have any programming background, that's fine! We could always use help with our documentation (both comments and Open API Standard 3 docs) or with new tutorials or guides. If you create an external resource, such as a tutorial or guide, we would love to link to it from here!

If you are experienced in Quality Assurance, we would love any feedback on bugs, typos, or things that could be improved. You can open a ticket or simply email us. Whatever works for you!

If you are a programmer with Go experience, we would love to have your help with this project. If you aren't sure where we need the most help, and the To Do list below seems daunting, you can always help with tests, clarifications, and QA.

Speak multiple languages? Although the API is mostly neutral in that regard, our web and mobile apps could always use a translation. Since none exist at this point, email us and we can talk about the best path forward here! Same with the docs!
